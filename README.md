# Gender Data

This package contains several data sets of use for historians and social
scientists studying gender. These data sets were compiled in this
package for use with the [gender][] package for predicting gender from
first names.

The raw data sets used in this package are available here:

-   [Mark Kantrowitz's name corpus][]
-   [Social Security Administration's baby names by year and state][]
-   [Social Security Administration's baby names by year][]
-   [IPUMS Census data][]

See also Hadley Wickham's [babynames][] package.
